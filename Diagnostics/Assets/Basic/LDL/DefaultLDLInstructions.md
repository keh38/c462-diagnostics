- Now that we know the softest sounds that you can hear, we want you to judge the **loudness** of different sounds
[br]
- There are several sliders on the following screens
- When you touch a sliderâ€™s button, you will hear a sound
- When you let go of the button, the sound will stop
[br]
- Your job is to make the sound louder, until it becomes uncomfortable
- Move the button up each slider to make the sound louder
- <color=#00AA00>Let go</color> of the button as soon as the loudness becomes uncomfortable
- This is **not** a test to to find the loudest sound you can tolerate
- It is a test to find the level of sound you find *uncomfortable*
[br]
- Let go of the slider as soon as the sound becomes uncomfortable
- If the highest point on the slider is not uncomfortable, just leave the slider there
[br]
- You will adjust many sliders on this test
- The pitch and loudness will vary from slider to slider
- So you will probably adjust each to a different point. That's OK
[br]
- After you have <color=#00AA00>*adjusted all the sliders*</color> on a screen, press the \"Lock In Sliders\" button to enter your settings
- The levels of the remaining tests will be set based on your loudness judgments during this test.
- For the remaining tests, we will never present a sound that meets or exceeds the level that you said was uncomfortable.
